        King Virat Kohli on his birthday joined Legend Sachin Tendulkar at the top of the ODI centurions list as India posted 326 and then had another head from their five-fanged bowling attack bury South Africa under this mountain of runs.
        Ravindra Jadeja waved the spin flag with gusto, finishing with 5 for 33 in a dominating 243-run win for the hosts which assures them of a top of the league standings finish for a second straight World Cup.
